                    <p>
                        Oil changes are the most common car maintenance task as oil performs a lot of esential functions in the car engine such as lubrication, temperature regulation and prevention of corrosion. It is recommended that you get your car oil changed every 3000
                        - 7500 miles for best car health. Monitor the oil level in your engine to determine when its time for an oil change.

                            3. Brake Maintenance
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            One cannot think of car tires without thinking of car brakes. Brakes are a very important safety feature on a car. The Car brake system should be inspected at least every 10,000 miles to ensure it is in proper working condition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Your car has both engine and cabin air filters responsilbe for filtering impurities out of the air being pumped into the engine and cabin of the car respectively. When these air filters become clogged or dirty, they become less efficient and could cause
                            damage to your engine or affect your passengers. Check engine air filters every 12,000 -15,000 miles and your cabin air filters every 15,000 - 30,000 miles and replace them if they're dirty.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Most car batteries need replacing every 3 - 5 years or so if all goes well but should be checked every six months or so. Bring your car in so we can check the battery charge and the terminal condition to ensure there is no corrosion or leakage. Regular
                            Battery maintenance checks ensure that your car starts reliably and safely.

                        <p>
                            To run smoothly, a car needs a number of special fluids which must be maintained at the right levels and without significant pollution. During Regular car maintenance checks, the level and condition of engine coolant should be checed every so often and
                            flushed every 2 years or so. The transmission fluid should be checked and replaced every 30,000 -60,000 miles and brake fluid should be checked every month or two. Also monitor the levels of power steering fluid. Most of these
                            fluids can be monitored by you at home.
                            <!--include a link to an article detailing how exactly to check fluid levels for the various fluids.-->

                            You should regularly check you car lights such as the headlights, brake lights and turn signals. Your interior lights for the car are also essential and should be checked as often as the rest of the lights. Replace your windshield wiper blades every so

                            Apart from the regular maintenance visits, it is important that you schedule some maintenance visits ahead of some important events or times. Here are 3 important visits to schedule

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            It is important to carry out car maintenance before the seasons of winter and summer to ensure your vehicle is well equipped to cope with the particular conditions of the season. Winter maintenance trips generally focus on having a strong-enough battery
                            and abundant anti-freeze as well as winter tires which ensure that youre equipped for the cold and slippery conditions. Summer maintenance focuses on ensuring that the radiator and cooling system are properly functional to
                            deal with the summer heat.

                            It is important to determine that your car is in proper working condition before embarking on long trips. This reduces the likelihood of breakdown while you or your family are in the middle of nowhere which can be very disturbing.
