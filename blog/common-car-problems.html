              Don’t Let Your Car Break Down: Identify These 7 Common Problems Early!
          </h1>
            <p> Maintaining your car can feel overwhelming. In this post, our expert mechanics share their knowledge about some of the most common car troubles, what they mean, and how they can affect your vehicle’s performance.

              Dashboard warning lights

          <p> Dashboard warning lights are very important features in modern vehicles, your friend designed to alert you to potential issues before they become major problems. <br>
              The most common is the check engine light, which can signal a range of issues from a loose gas cap to more serious engine problems. But it's not just the check engine light you need to watch out for. The oil pressure light means your car is low on oil, and your engine is at a risk of damage. The battery warning light suggests an issue with your charging systemor battery. And the brake warning light? That's a sign to check your brake fluid levels or get your brakes inspected right away.
